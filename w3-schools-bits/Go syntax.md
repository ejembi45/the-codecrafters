## What is Go syntax 
Go syntax are like the set of rules on how a programming language is  meant to write code correctly.


A Go file consists of the following parts:

  * Package declaration
  * Import packages
  * Functions
  * Statements and expressions


## Go Statements
fmt.Println("Hello World!") is a statement.

In Go, statements are separated by ending a line (hitting the Enter key) or by a semicolon ";".

Hitting the Enter key adds ";" to the end of the line implicitly (does not show up in the source code).

The left curly bracket { cannot come at the start of a line.

Run the following code and see what happens


## Go Compact Code

You can write more compact code, like shown below (this is not recommended because it makes the code more difficult to read)

## Example:
package main; import ("fmt"); func main() { fmt.Println("Hello World!");}
